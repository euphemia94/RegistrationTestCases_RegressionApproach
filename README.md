Regression Testing Approach
The regression testing approach focuses on maintaining checkout feature stability after code updates. Key steps include:

Identify Changes: Determine which parts of the code were modified.
Prioritize Tests: Select high-priority test cases for the affected areas.
Execute Tests: Run selected tests to confirm functionality is intact.
