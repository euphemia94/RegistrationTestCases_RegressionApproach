2. Describe your approach to regression testing after a code update on a checkout feature.


My Approach to Regression Testing
1. Review Code Changes: I will start by reviewing the update details to understand the specific areas affected in the checkout feature, such as payment processing, or shipping options.
2. Identify Critical Test Cases: After understanding the areas, i will identify high-priority test cases covering critical checkout functionalities.
3. Execute Test Cases for Impacted Areas: The next step is to run targeted regression tests for affected areas.
Broader Regression Testing: i will run additional tests on surrounding modules that interact with the checkout process, such as user profiles, inventory updates, and order history, to catch any indirect effects of the update.
4. Automated Tests: Run automated test scripts for the checkout flow and other linked features, to validate that key processes still function as expected after the update.
5. Reporting: After tests are complete, I will document any findings and confirm that all tests pass without issues.
